# DB Optimizer

## Getting started

- To get started, install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

- Next, run the analyzer script with `python main.py '[JSON FILE PATH]'`, replacing [JSON FILE PATH] with the path to the Explain Plan file to analyze.

- You can use the `data/sample_explain_plan.json` file to test.

## Examples

To see examples of how the data is analyzed, look at the `notebooks/example.ipynb` notebook.
